UI:
 When user's short bio is updated , and after that if user logs out,
 next time user is not able to login with his credentials. This looks like a serious issue,
 as during update the user has not touched anything related to credentials, but yet it got affected.
 I've picked up this test to automate, as it one of the important functionalities , and it could cause regressions
 later also. There is a good chance that every user might face the same issue.

 API:
  When user marks an article as favourite, the favourite count in the response doesn't increase.
  I picked this scenario up, as nowadays marking things as favourite on an app is quite common, and hence it
  could give users a bad experience if it is not fixed . I want to include it in the regression suite, so that if the problem appears
  again in the future , we can catch it easily.

 Risks/suggestions:
    1. emails are not validated if they are real or not.
    2. An user can create any number of articles with the exact same details.
    3. All the fields can have empty strings and yet an article can be created.
    4. Pagination is bad. the home page>global feed shows all the available page numbers.
       It should be shown as 10 or 7 per page.
    6. Using APIs when any article is created, it returns 200 status, as it is a resource creation operation, a 201 would have been nicer.
    5. API spec is confusing , especially auth information.
